NAME
    Email::MIME::Attachment::Stripper - Strip the attachments from a mail

SYNOPSIS
            my $stripper = Email::MIME::Attachment::Stripper->new($mail);

            my Email::MIME $msg = $stripper->message;
            my @attachments       = $stripper->attachments;

DESCRIPTION
    Given a Email::MIME object, detach all attachments from the message.
    These are then available separately.

METHODS
  new
            my $stripper = Email::MIME::Attachment::Stripper->new($mail, %args);

    This should be instantiated with a Email::MIME object. Current arguments
    supported:

    force_filename
       Try harder to get a filename, making one up if necessary.

  message
            my Email::MIME $msg = $stripper->message;

    This returns the message with all the attachments detached. This will
    alter both the body and the header of the message.

  attachments
            my @attachments = $stripper->attachments;

    This returns a list of all the attachments we found in the message, as a
    hash of { filename, content_type, payload }.
